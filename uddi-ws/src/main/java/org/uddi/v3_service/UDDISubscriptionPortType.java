 * Subscription provides clients, known as subscribers, with the ability to register their interest in receiving information concerning changes made in a UDDI registry.  These changes can be scoped based on preferences provided with the request.  The APIs described below support this capability.  Usage scenarios and examples are provided in Appendix C Supporting Subscribers.  Each of the subscription APIs described here are OPTIONAL for UDDI implementations and MAY be implemented entirely at the discretion of a Node.<br><br>
 * 
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">The subscription API set satisfies a variety of
requirements.&nbsp; The flexibility of the subscription API allows monitoring of activity
in a registry by registering to track new, changed and deleted entries for each
of these entities:</p>

</span></span>publisherAssertion (limited to those publisherAssertions for
which the subscriber owns at least one of the businesses referenced)</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">With the exception of single publisher registries
subscription typically is limited to authorized clients as a matter of node
policy.&nbsp; Therefore, subscribers MUST typically authenticate with the node
before saving subscription requests.&nbsp; Individual nodes, including those in the
UDDI Business Registry, MAY establish policies concerning the use of the
subscription APIs they choose to offer. Such policies might include restricting
the use of subscription, defining which APIs are supported, establishing
whether subscriptions require authentication, defining special rules affecting
different classes of subscriptions, or even imposing fees for the use of these
services.&nbsp; The use of the authInfo argument is OPTIONAL throughout the
subscription APIs, although registries which support multiple users or which
require authentication for publishing operations typically require it.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Subscription allows subscribers to "monitor" a
particular subset of data within a registry.&nbsp; Two patterns are defined.&nbsp; Nodes MAY support either or both:</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Asynchronous notification – subscribers choose to be
asynchronously notified by the node when registry data of interest changes via
calls to the notify_subscriptionListener API, which they implement as a "subscription
listener" service.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Synchronous change tracking – subscribers issue a synchronous
request using the get_subscriptionResults API to obtain information on activity
in the registry which matches their subscription preferences.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">A subscription request establishes criteria for the
subscription and specifies how and if the subscriber is to be notified of
changes matching the specified criteria.&nbsp; Any of the existing standard inquiry
APIs (find_xx and get_xx) may be used within a subscription request to define
the criteria, although nodes are free to restrict which inquiry APIs are
supported in subscription as a matter of policy.&nbsp; The duration, or life of a
subscription is also a matter of node policy, but subscribers can renew existing
subscriptions periodically instead of having to create new ones.&nbsp; Subscribers
may also create multiple subscriptions.&nbsp; Each subscription request is treated
independently.&nbsp; The level of detail provided for the data returned is
controlled by the subscription request.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">When asynchronous notifications are requested,
subscriptions provide information on new, changed or deleted entities within a
registry that occur <i>after</i> the point in time that the subscription is
registered.&nbsp; A node notifies subscribers based upon its identification of data
matching the requested subscription criteria.&nbsp; Subscribers can choose to have
these notifications provided via email or an HTTP/SOAP-based Web service, which
the subscriber MAY implement. Such services are called "subscription
listeners."&nbsp; Notifications are made periodically rather than in response
to the continuous stream of changes that normally occur within the registry.&nbsp;
This means that subscription results provided via notifications pertain only to
the <i>current</i> state of the entities at the time they are reported –
intermediate state changes are not provided.&nbsp; While subscribers can specify a
frequency for these notifications, nodes MAY choose to restrict this as a
matter of policy.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">When synchronous requests are made for subscription
results, the <i>current</i> state of the registry data, which matches the
subscription criteria, is returned for entries that were last created, changed
or deleted within a specified date range.&nbsp; Prior states of the registry data
are not available and are not returned.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Subscriptions are owned by the subscriber who creates
them.&nbsp; A subscriptionKey, which distinguishes each individual subscription, is
not visible to anyone except the subscriber.&nbsp; While node policy MAY permit others besides the subscription’s owner to receive or retrieve subscription results,
such interested parties require knowledge of the relevant subscriptionKey from
the subscription owner in order to do so.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">As stated above, the subscription API allows monitoring of
new, changed and deleted entities. This section provides the definition of
changed entities.&nbsp; The following are the criteria for considering an entity to
have been "changed":</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;
margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>For businessEntity, businessService, bindingTemplate, and tModel:
<br>
The entity is considered to be changed if the modifiedIncludingChildren element
of the operationalInfo element of the entity has been changed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;
margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>For publisherAssertion:<br>
A publisherAssertion is considered to be changed if the publisher has updated
the publisherAssertion via the set_publisherAssertions,&nbsp; or
add_publisherAssertions APIs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;
margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>For related businessEntity: <br>
A related businessEntity (related to the business specified in the businessKey
argument of find_relatedBusinesses API) is considered to be changed if either:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;
margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the related businessEntity is changed, or</p>

margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:-.25in">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>at least one of the two reciprocal publisherAssertions that represents
the relationship is changed.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Time durations used in the subscription APIs are of type
xsd:duration defined in XML Schema from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/#ISO8601"><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none">[ISO 8601]</span></a>.&nbsp; Any form

representation extended format can be used, which is of the form PnYnMnDTnHnMnS,
where nY represents the number of years, nM the number of months, nD the number
of days, 'T' is the date/time separator, nH the number of hours, nM the number
of minutes and nS the number of seconds. The "P" identifies the field
as duration.&nbsp; The number of seconds can include decimal digits to arbitrary
precision.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Points in time used in the subscription APIs are all of
the XML Schema type, xsd:dateTime.&nbsp; Two points in time are used to specify a
period of time.</p>

Coverage Period</a></h3>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The APIs, which support each of the patterns previously
described for obtaining subscription results, accept a coveragePeriod argument,
which is composed of two points in time.&nbsp; Each of these corresponds to the last
point in time which any given entity in the registry was modified (i.e.,
created, deleted or changed).&nbsp; The syntax of this element is:</p>

</span></span><b>startPoint</b>: Signifies the point in time after which
subscription results are to be collected and/or returned. The startPoint is
optional. If it is not specified, this indicates that all available results are
to be returned from the beginning of the registry.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>endPoint</b>:&nbsp; Signifies the point in time corresponding to
the last activity date for entities matching subscription results.&nbsp; No activity
among matching entities, which occurred after this point in time, is returned.
The endPoint is optional. If not provided, it signifies that the latest changes
available, which match the subscription criterions that are to be returned. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">With respect to notifications, the startPoint of a given
notification SHOULD align with the endPoint of the previous notification.&nbsp; If
this is not the case, the subscriber SHOULD assume a notification was missed,
or lost.&nbsp; The subscriber can then take corrective action by using the
get_subscriptionResults API. Note that it is permissible for nodes to send the
same data more than once, depending on overlaps in these times.</p>

of Returned Subscription Data</a><a name="_Ref535517771"></a></h3>

<p class="MsoBodyText">If a subscriber specifies a maximum number of entries to
be returned with a subscription and the amount of data to be returned exceeds
this limit, or if the node determines based on its policy that there are too
many entries to be returned in a single group, then the node SHOULD provide a
chunkToken with results.&nbsp; The chunkToken is a string based token which is used
by the node to maintain the state of the subscription results for a particular
caller, when these results are chunked across multiple responses.&nbsp; The format
and content of the chunkToken is a matter of implementation choice by
individual nodes. The chunkToken returned with a particular subscription result
set SHOULD be used to retrieve subsequent results when subscription results are
requested in a synchronous manor.&nbsp; If no more results are pending, the value of
the chunkToken MUST be "0".</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">A chunkToken is intended as a short-term aid in obtaining
contiguous results across multiple API calls and is therefore likely to remain
valid for only a short time.&nbsp; Nodes MAY establish policies on how long a
chunkToken remains valid.</p>

of keyBag in Subscription</a></h3>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The subscription results returned by the subscription APIs
allow for the use of a structure called a keyBag.&nbsp; A keyBag contains a list of
entity keys, which correspond to any of the core data structures
(businessEntity, businessService, bindingTemplate or tModel).&nbsp; The keyBag has
two uses.&nbsp; </p>

match the subscription criteria provided with the subscription.&nbsp; This later
situation is referred to as a "virtual delete", in that the entity in
question may not actually have be deleted from the registry, but it no longer
matches the criterion which the subscriber defined in the subscription for
tracking registry changes.&nbsp; It should be noted that nodes MUST maintain
information pertaining to registry changes for both forms of deletion, to be
reported with subscription results for applicable subscriptions, although they MAY establish policies on how long such information is retained. Further details on the use of
this structure are discussed in the relevant API sections that follow.&nbsp; When
the keyBag is used for deleted entities, the deleted element is set to "true,"
and all entities listed in such a keyBag are assumed to represent deletions.<br>

Notifications are not returned synchronously with results for this API.  Only data that matches the requested subscription criteria and which changes after the point in time that the subscription request is accepted is returned to the subscriber via a notification.

This API returns a duration for which this particular subscription is valid.  Depending upon the policy of the Node, subscriptions need to be renewed before the expiration date in order to insure that they remain active.  Subscriptions can also be redefined or renewed using this API.  The subscriptionKey pertaining to the subscription to be renewed must be supplied in the save_subscription invocation in order to accomplish this. This allows both renewal and changes to the subscription.  Invoking save_subscription automatically resets the expiration period for the subscription in question to a value based upon the node’s policy.

subscriptionFilter.&nbsp; Only one of these can be chosen for each subscription.&nbsp;
Notifications, based on the subscriptionFilter, are sent to the subscriber if
and only if there are changes at the node, which match this criterion during a
notification period.&nbsp; A subscriptionFilter MUST contain exactly one of the
allowed inquiry elements. The authInfo argument of the specified get_xx or

dissolved, or requested by the owners of some other business.</p>

deleted publisher assertions is different from the case when a business entity,
business service, binding template, or tModel is removed. In the latter case,
