<div class="block">This portType defines all of the UDDI custody transfer operations. This
 section defines the UDDI Custody and Ownership Transfer API Set[28]. Data
 custody is introduced in Section 1.5.6 Data Custody. Ownership transfer is
 introduced in Section 1.5.7 Transfer of Ownership. By virtue of having
 created an entity, a publisher has ownership of the entity and is said to be
 the owner of the entity. A custodial node MUST maintain a relationship of
 ownership between an entity and its publisher by means of authorization
 mechanisms. Every node of a multi-node registry MUST guarantee the integrity
 of an entity's custody. As such, a node MUST not permit changes to an entity
 unless it has custody of it.

 The Custody and Ownership Transfer API Set enables any nodes of a registry to
 cooperatively transfer custody of one or more businessEntity or tModel
 structures from one node to another, as well as allowing the transfer of
 ownership of these structures from one publisher to another. Associated
 entities of a businessEntity such as its businessService, bindingTemplate,
 and publisherAssertion structures are transferred as part of the custody
 transfer of the business entity. * From a custody transfer point of view, the
 publishers are always distinct, though it may be the case that the publishers
 are the same person. Also, the two nodes may or may not be distinct;
 intra-node transfer between two publishers is simply a degenerate case in
 which node custody does not change. Thus, in the case of an inter-node
 transfer, ownership transfer is implied. In the case of an intra-node
 transfer the behavior results in the transfer of ownership between two
 publishers.

 For example, one UDDI registry, UDDI-1, MAY allow each node in UDDI-1
 (composed of nodes 1A, 1B and 1C) to define its own policies for
 registration, authentication and authorization. In this case, a "person",
 (P1) would need to review the policies of all 3 nodes and decide upon the
 node with which it chooses to register with. P1 may choose to register with
 more than one node. P1 registers with node1A . Node1A also specifies how P1
 is authenticated. If P1 successfully authenticates and publishes a business
 entity (BE1) then P1 becomes the "owner" of BE1. Node1A is said to be the
 "custodian" of BE1. P1 can also register at node1B. If P1 successfully
 authenticates and publishes a business entity (BE2) then P1 becomes the
 "owner" of BE2. Node1B is said to be the "custodian" of BE2. There is no
 assumption that the registry UDDI-1 or its nodes (node1A and node1B) are
 aware that P1 is the same "person". P1 is responsible for maintaining the
 appropriate identity and authenticating correctly to each node within a
 registry.

 Another UDDI registry, UDDI-2, MAY require each of its nodes (node2-1,
 node2-2 and node2-3) to use the same registration, authentication and
 authorization mechanisms. In this case, the policies are the same across all
 nodes. The relationship of registration, publication and ownership remains
 the same. If P1 wants to register with different nodes in UDDI-2, then it
 needs to differentiate its registration with the different nodes, since an
 attempt to register at node2-2 after registering at node2-1, would fail as
 "already registered" (since by policy the nodes all share the same
 registration, authentication and authorization).

 5.4.1 Overview There are a number of scenarios where a publisher may choose
 to transfer custodianship or ownership of one or more entities. These are
 described in this section.

 5.4.1.1 Intra-Node Ownership Transfer Intra-node ownership transfer involves
 transferring entity ownership from one publisher to another within the same
 UDDI node. Usage scenarios for this type of transfer include the following:

 · Businesses or organizational merges: Multiple organizations need to be
 consolidated under the control of a single publisher.

 · Domain key generators: One use of ownership transfer is the transfer of
 ownership of a derived key generator from one publisher to another to enable
 her or him to publish entities using keys in that domain.

 The save_xx APIs can also be used to move entities between parent entities
 that are owned by the same publisher. The save_service API, for example, can
 be used to move services (and binding templates) between one business entity
 and another as described in Section 5.2.17.3 Behavior of the save_service
 API. Changing the parent relationship in this way causes two businessEntity
 structures to be changed. Doing so enables the following scenarios:

 · Divestitures: An organization needs to reassign the control of a set of
 services to two or more publishers.

 · Consolidation of registry entities: There are multiple entities for a given
 business that are to be consolidated under a single publisher.

 5.4.1.2 Inter-Node Custody Transfer Inter-node custody transfer involves the
 custody transfer of a set of entities across nodes of a UDDI registry. A
 transfer of ownership ensues as a consequence of this custody transfer. In
 addition to the intra-node scenarios described above, inter-node custody
 transfer may be used to address the following use cases:

 · Unsatisfactory service level: The functionality or service level provided
 by a given node operator is insufficient, and the publisher wishes to move
 their UDDI data to another node.

 · Change in availability for a UDDI node: A node is no longer providing UDDI
 services, and all publishers need to be migrated to one or more nodes of the
 registry.

 · Organizational Mergers, Divestitures or Consolidations: Changes in
 organizational structure may result in the need to make changes to the set of
 publishers used to manage the entities at various nodes of a registry.

 For any of these intra and inter-node scenarios, a mechanism is specified to
 facilitate the transfer the custody of businessEntity and tModel entities
 between nodes whether the entity is being transferred within a single node or
 whether a custody transfer occurs between nodes of a registry.

 5.4.2 Custody Transfer Considerations When a businessEntity is transferred,
 all related businessService and bindingTemplate elements are transferred as
 well. In addition, any publisherAssertion elements that reference the
 businessEntity element’s businessKey that are owned by the publisher are also
 transferred.

 Note that the relinquishing publisher is not required to transfer all of its
 UDDI entities (i.e. businessEntity and/or tModel entities) in a single
 custody transfer request, nor is it required to transfer all of its entities
 to the same target publisher or target node. Any combination or subset of
 UDDI registry entities may be transferred to any number of target publishers
 or nodes.

 5.4.3 Transfer Execution The Custody and Ownership Transfer API Set enables
 two publishers P1 and P2 and two nodes, N1 and N2, in a registry to
 cooperatively transfer custody of one or more existing businessEntity or
 tModel structures, E1…En, from N1 to N2 and, and by extension to transfer
 ownership of the entities from P1 to P2. Related businessService,
 bindingTemplate, and publisherAssertion structures are transferred with their
 related businessEntities. From the registry’s point of view, the publishers
 are always distinct, though it may be the case that P1 and P2 are the same
 party. The two nodes may or may not be distinct; intra-node transfer of
 ownership from P1 to P2 is simply a degenerate case in which node custody
 does not change.

 The Custody and Ownership Transfer API Set is divided into two parts, a set
 of two client APIs and a single inter-node API. These client APIs are
 get_transferToken and transfer_entities; in short, this constitutes the
 Ownership Transfer API portion of this API set. The inter-node-API is
 transfer_ custody which when combined with replication makes up the Custody
 Transfer API portion of this API set. * The overall flow of custody and
 ownership transfer is as follows:

 Publisher P1 invokes get_transferToken on N1, specifying the keys K1…Kn of
 the entities E1…En that are to be transferred. If P1 is authorized to do this
 (i.e., if P1 has ownership of E1…En), N1 returns a structure T, called a
 transfer token, that represents authority to transfer the entities, including
 all of the naturally contained children and publisher assertions related to
 business entities involved in the transfer that are owned by P1. The
 transferToken is a structure that consists of an opaque string that is
 meaningful only to the node that issued it, an expiration time, and a node
 identifier.

 P1 then gives T to P2 (typically by some secure means since T is valuable).
 The publisher obtaining the custody information needs to have previously
 obtained a publishers account on the node accepting custody of the entity
 before he/she can complete the custody transfer. P2 then invokes
 transfer_entities on N2, passing K1…Kn and T. If transfer_entities completes
 successfully, the entities E1…En and their related structures
 (businessService, bindingTemplate, and publisherAssertion) are in the custody
 of N2 and are owned by P2. If the operation fails, nothing happens to the
 entities. The actual transfer proceeds as follows, in the processing of
 transfer_entities.

 If N1 and N2 are not distinct nodes, the ownership transfer from P1 to P2 is
 an operation that is purely internal to the node – how it happens is up to
 the implementation. If N1 and N2 are distinct, the following protocol occurs
 while processing the transfer_entities request on N2.

 Upon receipt of a transfer_entities request, N2 checks that K1…Kn are valid
 keys. There is the possibility that P1 might transfer more data than P2 can
 accept due to policy-based restrictions on the limit of entities allowed to
 be owned by P2 at N2. As is described below, replication is used to complete
 the custody transfer process. A question that arises is at the time of
 accepting the datum related to the transfer, could N2 throw a replication
 error because the data being transferred exceeds the limits of user P2? Such
 limits can not be enforced during replication because they are node-local
 policy decisions from the perspective of enforcement. Thus, it is therefore
 possible that as a result of a custody transfer a publisher may be caused to
 hold more data that he/she would have been able to publish. Should this
 situation occur, P2 MUST not be allowed to publish any additional data unless
 P2 first reduces the number of entries it owns to an allowable limit.

 If all is well, N2 invokes the inter-node API transfer_custody on N1,
 presenting the keys of top-level entities to be transferred, K1…Kn, P2’s
 identity (using the publisher’s authorizedName), N2’s node identifier (as
 known in the Replication Configuration structure, see Section 7.5.2
 Configuration of a UDDI Node – operator element), and T. The transferToken,
 T, implies permission to transfer the entire content of the entities it
 identifies, including all of the contained entities and related
 publisherAssertions, if any. N1 checks to see whether T is a valid
 transferToken that it issued and that T represents the authority to transfer
 E1…En. If the validation is successful, N1 prevents further changes to
 entities E1…En. N1 then updates the authorizedName and nodeID of the
 operationalInfo of E1…En and related entities so that they are shown to be in
 the custody of N2 and owned by P2. Finally, N1 responds to N2 which triggers
 N2 to respond to the transfer_entities caller. This completes the processing
 for the transfer_entities request.

 In the case that the datum being transferred is a key generator tModel, N1
 will disallow further generation of keys associated with this key partition
 at its node.

 Following the issue of the empty message by N1 to the transfer_custody call,
 N1 will submit into the replication stream a changeRecordNewData providing in
 the operationalInfo, N2’s nodeID identifying it as the node where the datum
 is being transferred to, and the authorizedName of P2. The
 acknowledgmentRequested attribute of this change record MUST be set to
 "true".

 The last modified date timestamp in the operationalInfo must change to
 reflect the custody transfer. Figure 2 depicts the flow of a custody transfer
 between P1 and P2. This class was generated by the JAX-WS RI. JAX-WS RI

<div class="block">The get_transferToken API is a client API used to initiate the transfer
 of custody of one or more businessEntity or tModel entities from one node
 to another. As previously stated, the two nodes may or may not be
 distinct; intra-node transfer between two publishers is simply a
 degenerate case in which node custody does not change. No actual transfer
 takes place with the invocation of this API. Instead, this API obtains
 permission from the custodial node, in the form of a transferToken, to
 perform the transfer. The publisher who will be recipient of the
 transferToken returned by this API must invoke the transfer_entities API
 on the target custodial node to actually transfer the entities.</div>

 nodeID, an expirationTime and an opaqueToken. The nodeID is used during
 the transfer_entities API by the recipient node to confirm with the
 relinquishing custodial node that the custody transfer is authorized and
 still valid. The nodeID of the transferToken is the value of the nodeID
 element of the Replication Configuration Structure. Refer to Section
 7.5.2 Configuration of a UDDI Node – operator Element.</dd>
<dd><code>expirationTime</code> - this is a return value. The expirationTime, defined
 as xsd:dateTime, represents the time at which the transfer token is no
 longer valid.</dd>
<dd><code>opaqueToken</code> - this is a return value. The opaqueToken is only
 meaningful to the node that issues it. The opaqueToken is defined as
