This is a on going effort to port the entire juddi-client and uddi-ws over to .NET

Goals
-Public APIs should mirror the juddi-client as much as possible
-WSDL and WADL to UDDI models
-Use the juddi-client configuration file if possible
-Inclusive of UDDI API documentation
-Hopefully work in both Microsoft's .NET and with Mono
-Use WCF behaviors and annotations to add the necessary hooks

It is not yet complete!

Mono users, make sure you use juddi-client.net-mono.sln when building!
