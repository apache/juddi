Note: not all settings are editable. The "save" function may not be available in all deployments. Note: After clicking on 'Save', there may be up to a 5-10 second delay before the changes are reflected. In addition, you may have to restart the container in order for the changes to be in effect.

pages.tmodelpart.title=tModel Key Generators (Partitions)
pages.tmodelpart.content=TModel Key Generators are a special kind of tModel that enables you to define new tModels with any arbitrary tModel prefix that you want. For example, if you wanted a tModel defined as "uddi:www.mycompany.com:ServiceAuthenticationMethod", you would first have to create a tModel key generator with the value of "uddi:www.mycompany.com:keyGenerator". This is part of the UDDI specification and acts as a governance mechanism. You can also create a tModel Key Generator by using the Creat tModel menu option and by adding the appropriate settings.

pages.viewsubscriptions.content=UDDI offers the ability for users to subscribe for notification to changes in most entities within a UDDI registry. However, the notification part is a bit strange. Users of strict UDDIv3 registries have only one option, periodically poll the UDDI registry for changes via the Subscription API. Although there's data types defined within the UDDI v3 specification, there's no API method for setting up a callback style of subscription, where the registry user hosts a web service that waits for notifications. In a callback subscription, those that need the information are notified immediately.

Some registries impose limits on the number of binding templates per service.

Publishers represent one or more logins or usernames.<br><Br>Transfers can occur within a UDDI registry node (intra-node) and between multiple registries nodes (inter-node). This utility will help you setup intra-node transfers only. No known UDDI implementations support inter-node transfers (replication API's are not implemented.<br><br>The process is straightforward, select what entities you want to transfer, then click OK. A token will be presented to you which then need to give to the other publisher. The other publisher then needs to accept the token and transfer the ownership to the publisher. Finally, the token is then destroyed to prevent any inadvertent transfers.<br>Transfers can be aborted (token invalidated) before the other publisher transfers the ownership over. Once it's been transfered and you want to undo the transfer, contact the registry administrator and the other publisher.

Create these standard UDDI entries by providing the URL to the WADL of the service you want to map into the UDDI registry.

The OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/uddi-spec/doc/tn/uddi-spec-tc-tn-wsdl-v2.htm">Technical Note</a> details this.

If you don't know where to find it                             you can usually add a '?wsdl' to the end of the URL to the service. WSDLs are XML documents.

If you don't know where to find it                             you can usually add a '?_wadl' to the end of the URL to the service. WADLs are XML documents.

actions.delete.binding=Binding deleted successfully.
andAllKeys=This changes the behavior for identifierBag to AND keys rather than OR them. This is already the default for categoryBag and tModelBag.
approximateMatch=Wildcard searches, use _ for single character matches, % for multiple character matches.
binarySort=This qualifier allows for greater speed in sorting. It causes a binary sort by name, as represented in Unicode codepoints.
bindingSubset=This is used in the find_business API or the find_service API and is used only in conjunction with a categoryBag argument. It causes the component of the search that involves categorization to use only the categoryBag elements from contained bindingTemplate elements within the registered data and ignores any entries found in the categoryBag which are not direct descendent elements of registered businessEntity elements or businessService elements.
caseInsensitiveMatch=Signifies that the matching behavior for name, keyValue and keyName (where applicable) should be performed without regard to case.
caseInsensitiveSort=Signifies that the result set should be sorted without regard to case. This overrides the default case sensitive sorting behavior (Not supported by jUDDI).
caseSensitiveMatch=Signifies that the matching behavior for name, keyValue and keyName (where applicable) should be performed with regard to case. This is the default behavior.
caseSensitiveSort=Signifies that the result set should be sorted with regard to case. This is the default behavior.
combineCategoryBags=This may only be used in the find_business and find_service calls. In the case of find_business, this qualifier makes the categoryBag entries for the full businessEntity element behave as though all categoryBag elements found at the businessEntity level and in all contained or referenced businessService elements and bindingTemplate elements were combined.
diacriticInsensitiveMatch=Signifies that matching behavior for name, keyValue and keyName (where applicable) should be performed without regard to diacritics. Support for this findQualifier by nodes is optional.
UTS-10=This is used to cause sorting of results based on the Unicode Collation Algorithm on elements normalized according to Unicode Normalization Form C.
suppressProjectedServices=Signifies that service projections MUST NOT be returned by the find_service or find_business APIs with which this findQualifier is associated. This findQualifier is automatically enabled by default whenever find_service is used without a businessKey.
sortByDateDesc=Causes the result set returned by a find_xx or get_xx inquiry call to be sorted based on the most recent date when each entity, or any entities they contain, were last updated, in descending chronological order (most recently changed are returned first.
sortByDateAsc=Causes the result set returned by a find_xx or get_xx inquiry call to be sorted based on the most recent date when each entity, or any entities they contain, were last updated, in ascending chronological order (oldest are returned first).
sortByNameDesc=Causes the result set returned by a find_xx or get_xx inquiry call to be sorted on the name field in descending order.
sortByNameAsc=Causes the result set returned by a find_xx or get_xx inquiry APIs to be sorted on the name field in ascending order.
serviceSubset=This is used only with the find_business API and is used only in conjunction with a categoryBag argument. 
orLikeKeys=When a bag container (i.e. categoryBag or identifierBag) contains multiple keyedReference elements, any keyedReference filters that come from the same namespace (e.g. have the same tModelKey value) are OR\u2019d together rather than AND\u2019d. 
orAllKeys=This changes the behavior for tModelBag and categoryBag to OR the keys within a bag, rather than to AND them.
signaturePresent=This is used with any find_xx API to restrict the result set to entities which either contain an XML Digital Signature element, or are contained in an entity which contains one.
exactMatch=Signifies that only entries with names, keyValues and keyNames (where applicable) that exactly match the name argument passed in, after normalization, will be returned.
diacriticSensitiveMatch=Signifies that the matching behavior for name, keyValue and keyName (where applicable) should be performed with regard to diacritics. This is the default behavior.
