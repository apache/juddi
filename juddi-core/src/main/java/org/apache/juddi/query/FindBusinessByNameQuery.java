/**
 * Returns the list of business keys possessing the Names in the passed Name list.
 * Output is restricted by list of business keys passed in.  If null, all businesses are searched.
 * Output is produced by building the appropriate JPA query based on input and find qualifiers.
 *
 * From specification:
 * "This optional collection of string values represents one or more names potentially qualified with xml:lang attributes. 
 * Since "exactMatch" is the default behavior, the value supplied for the name argument must be an exact match.  If the "approximateMatch" 
 * findQualifier is used together with an appropriate wildcard character in the name, then any businessEntity matching this name with 
 * wildcards and the other criteria will be referenced in the results.  For more on wildcard matching, see Section 5.1.6 About Wildcards.   
 * The businessList returned contains businessInfo structures for businesses whose name matches the value(s) passed 
 * (lexical-order match i.e., leftmost in left-to-right languages).  If multiple name values are passed, the match occurs on a 
 * logical OR basis. Each name MAY be marked with an xml:lang adornment.  If a language markup is specified, the search results report a 
 * match only on those entries that match both the name value and language criteria. The match on language is a leftmost case-insensitive 
 * comparison of the characters supplied. This allows one to find all businesses whose name begins with an "A" and are expressed in any 
 * dialect of French, for example.  Values which can be passed in the language criteria adornment MUST obey the rules governing the 
 * xml:lang data type as defined in Section 3.3.2.3 name."
