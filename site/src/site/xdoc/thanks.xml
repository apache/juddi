         Xceptance LoadTest (XLT) for both regression as well as load tests by <a href="http://www.gqpartners.com/">Global Quality Partners, LLC</a> 
         and <a href="http://www.xceptance.com/">Xceptance 
         Software Technologies, Inc.</a> Load and performance tests were created and 
         executed by our sponsors using Xceptance LoadTest (XLT) from Xceptance 
         Software Technologies, Inc., of which Global Quality Partners, LLC is 
         the exclusive North American distributor. To enable the Apache jUDDI 
         project to continue and extend these tests, Xceptance has provided 
         an unlimited XLT license and donated the source code of the test suite 
         to the Apache jUDDI project. XLT is built and scripted in pure Java, 
         providing a highly scalable and easily adaptable technology that can be 
         used across development, quality assurance, and consulting teams.
