## Notifiers

### Email

Configuration for notifying developers/users when a build is unsuccessful, including user information and notification mode is done via the [development mailing list](mailing-list.html).

### IRC

The jUDDI project also employs the BuildBot's IRC bot, which enables us to trigger builds manually and to make alterations to the build process.
