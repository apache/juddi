# Apache jUDDI Client and GUI Guide

## Dedication

We'd like to dedicate this guide to Steve Viens and Andy Cutright who started this project back in 2003.

## Preface

The jUDDI client framework facilitates interaction with any UDDI v3 compliant registry. In addition to providing a client framework for both Java and .NET, it also provides a self proclaimed Technical Compatilibity Test (TCK) Suite. The jUDDI community encourages collabration of other vendors on the TCK or on the client framework in general.
