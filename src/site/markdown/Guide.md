# Apache jUDDI Guide

## Dedication

We'd like to dedicate this guide to Steve Viens and Andy Cutright who started this project back in 2003.

## Preface

The jUDDI project maintains a UDDIv3 registry that can be deployed to most modern JEE application servers. The jUDDI project is part of the Apache Software Foundation and encourages participation. It is easy to participate and if you discover a simple typo or would like to contribute to this guide in general please read the README page (add link).
