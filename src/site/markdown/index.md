## Introduction
jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org) the [Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI)](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#uddiv3.0.2) specification for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes [Scout](http://projects.apache.org/projects/scout.html). Scout is an implementation of the [JSR 93 - JavaTM API for XML Registries 1.0 (JAXR)](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=93).

## Features

 - Open Source
 - Platform Independent
 - Use with any relational database that supports ANSI standard SQL (MySQL, Oracle, DB2, Sybase, Derby etc.)
 - Deployable on any Java application server that supports the Servlet 2.3 specification
 - jUDDI registry supports a clustered deployment configuration.
 - Easy integration with existing authentication systems
 - Supports InVM embeddable mode

## About UDDI

The Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) protocol is one of the major building blocks required for successful Web services. UDDI creates a standard interoperable platform that enables companies and applications to quickly, easily, and dynamically find and use Web services over the Internet. UDDI also allows operational registries to be maintained for different purposes in different contexts. UDDI is a cross-industry effort driven by major platform and software providers, as well as marketplace operators and e-business leaders within the OASIS standards consortium.

Additional information regarding UDDI can be found at [uddi.xml.org](http://uddi.xml.org/).
