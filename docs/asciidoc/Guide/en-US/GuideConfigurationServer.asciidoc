[[jUDDIServerConfig]]
== jUDDI Server Configuration (`juddiv3.xml`)

jUDDI will look for a `juddiv3.xml` file on the root of the classpath. In the `juddiv3.war` you can find it in `juddiv3.war/WEB_INF/classes/juddiv3.xml`.
----
Since 3.2 the jUDDI server now uses an XML file for configuration. Previous versions uses a properties file.

IMPORTANT: When referring to configuration 'properties', we are really referencing the XPath to specified setting.

=== Deploying two or more jUDDI server on the same application server

.It is possible to deploy one or more jUDDI servers to the same application server. You will need copy the juddiv3.war archive (let's say you copied it to juddiv3a.war), and change the following settings to have it connect to a different database:

1. edit the `juddiv3a/META-INF/context.xml` (and `conf/Catalina/localhost/juddiv3a.xml`) to use the _jdbc/JuddiADS_ datasource, and add 'a' to the url: `url="jdbc:derby:target/juddi-derby-test-db-v3a;create=true"`
2. edit the _juddiv3a/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/persistence.xml_ to use `<non-jta-data-source>java:comp/env/jdbc/JuddiADS` and `persistence-unit name="juddiADatabase"`
3. edit the _juddiv3a/WEB-INF/classes/juddiv3.xml_ to have
`<persistenceunit><name>juddiADatabase</name></persistenceunit>`

This will create a new jUDDI server under the http://localhost:8080/juddiv3a url which connects to the juddi-derby-test-db-v3a Derby database.


=== jUDDI GUI Configuration

The jUDDI GUI (juddi-gui.war) has one place for configuration settings, the jUDDI Client config file.

=== jUDDI Client uddi.xml Settings

Defined in WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/uddi.xml, there are many settings to configure. All of these are clearly defined by the jUDDI Client Configuration Guide. The juddi-gui, uses things a bit differently, so here are the relevant parts to use. Note: this is xpath notation.

* uddi/client/nodes/properties, not used

* uddi/client/clerks, not used

* uddi/client/nodes/node, all URLs except juddiApiUrl (not used)

* uddi/client/signature, all validation related settings

* uddi/client/subscriptionCallbacks, not used

* uddi/client/XtoWsdl, not used

In addition, there a special section added just for the juddi-gui.war

.jUDDI GUI Configuration
[options="header"]
|===========================================================================================
|Property Name                   |Description       |Required       |Default Value or [Example Value]
|_uddi/config/props/authtype_            |This controls the authentication mode to connect to a UDDI server. Most implementations of UDDI use the security service, however others use HTTP based authentication. In this case, us the value of 'HTTP', otherwise 'UDDI_AUTH' |Y                         |_UDDI_AUTH_

|_uddi/config/props/enableAutomaticLogouts_      |This flag determines whether automatic logouts is enabled. By default, jUDDI-gui sets this to false for ease of use. (true/false)|N  |_false_

|_udddi/config/props/enableAutomaticLogouts/duration_      |Time in milliseconds to force an automatic logout after inactivity.|N  |_900000_
|_uddi/config/props/configLocalHostOnly_  |If false, the configuration page will be available from anywhere. If true, it will only be accessible from the server hosting juddi-gui. (true/false) |N   |_true_


|===========================================================================================

=== Encryption Keys

By default, the juddi-gui will use a randomly generated AES encryption key to help protect user credentials stored in the session object. This key is generated using the "StartupServlet" defined in the web.xml file of juddi-gui.war/WEB-INF/web.xml and then it is stored at the path juddi-gui.war/META-INF/config.properties@key. 

If the start up servlet fails to start, any authenticate operation of the juddi-gui will fail.

IMPORTANT: The user account that the container for juddi-gui runs as must have write access to the file juddi-gui.war/META-INF/config.properties.

=== Customizing the juddi-gui

The juddi-gui has a mechanism that you can use to alter the appearance of every page. This is typically used for organizations that require legal notifications, banners or warnings on every page for one reason or another. To add your own html to every page, edit the file in 
----
juddi-gui/user/banner.jsp
