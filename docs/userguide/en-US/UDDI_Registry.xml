        <para>
        The Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) protocol is one of the
        major building blocks required for successful Web services. UDDI creates a standard
        interoperable platform that enables companies and applications to quickly, easily, and
        dynamically find and use Web services over the Internet. UDDI also allows operational
        registries to be maintained for different purposes in different contexts. UDDI is a
        cross-industry effort driven by major platform and software providers, as well as
        marketplace operators and e-business leaders within the OASIS standards consortium.
        UDDI has gone through 3 revisions and the latest version is 3.0.2. Additional
        information regarding UDDI can be found at <ulink url="http://uddi.xml.org"/>.

        <para>
        The UDDI Registry implements the UDDI specification. UDDI is a Web-based distributed
        directory that enables businesses to list themselves on the Internet and discover each
        other, similar to a traditional phone book's yellow and white pages. The UDDI registry
        is both a white pages business directory and a technical specifications library. The
        Registry is designed to store information about Businesses and Services and it holds
        references to detailed documentation.

        <para>
        A business publishes services to the UDDI registry. A client looks up the service in
        the registry and receives service binding information. The client then uses the binding
        information to invoke the service. The UDDI APIs are SOAP based for interoperability
        reasons. The UDDI v3 specification defines 9 APIs:

        <para>
        Within jUDDI, there are three downloadable files (juddi-core.jar, juddi.war, and
        juddi-tomcat.zip). You should determine which one to use depending on what level of
        integration you want with your application and your platform / server choices.
        </para>
        
        Using the JAR

        The juddi-core module produces a JAR which contains the jUDDI source and a jUDDI
        persistence.xml configuration. jUDDI's persistence is being actively tested with both
        OpenJPA and with Hibernate.

        If you are going to use only the JAR, you would need to directly insert objects into jUDDI
        through the database backend or persistence layer, or configure your own Webservice
        provider with the provided WSDL files and classes.

        Using the WAR files

        As with the JAR, you need to make a decision on what framework you would like to use when
        building the WAR. There will eventually be two WAR files shipped – one using CXF and one
        using Axis 2. For the alpha release, only CXF has been tested thoroughly.

        Simple copy the WAR to the deploy folder of your server (this release has been tested
        under Apache Tomcat 5.5.23), start your server, and follow the directions under “using
        jUDDI as a Web Service”.

        Using the Tomcat Bundle

        The jUDDI Tomcat bundle packages up the jUDDI WAR, Apache Derby, and a few necessary
        configuration files and provides the user with a pre-configured jUDDI instance. By
        default, the Hibernate is used as the persistence layer and CXF is used as a Web Serice
        framework.

        To get started using the Tomcat bundle, unzip the juddi-tomcat-bundle.zip, and start
        Tomcat :

        % cd apache-tomcat-5.5.23/bin % ./startup.sh 
        
        Using jUDDI as Web Service

        Browse to http://localhost:8080/juddi/services

        The services page shows you the available endpoints and methods available. Using any SOAP
        client, you should be able to send some sample requests to jUDDI to test:

        Using jUDDI with your application

        As of the Alpha release, two of the UDDI v3 APIs should be active within jUDDI : inquiry
        and publish.
